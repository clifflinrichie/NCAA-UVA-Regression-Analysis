The program was written in SAS and features many common data analysis practice, such as explanatory data anaylsis and  modeling by step. The original data taken off of Kaggle was converted using code to create dummy variables to test qualitative variables. 

Interaction and higher-order terms were all tested by nested F-tests. After numerous testing, it was found that the most significant variables that affect points per game are field goal percentage, assists, 3 point percentage, free throws, and turnovers.
